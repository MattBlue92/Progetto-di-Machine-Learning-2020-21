But at midday, a decline in the price of oil led markets lower.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 23 points, or 0.1%, to 17896 and the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 0.4%.</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S.-traded crude oil for August delivery fell 4.8% to $45.14 a barrel as data showed inventories fell less than expected and investors worried that global demand was softening. Stocks traded slightly higher Thursday morning before switching direction around noon, after the oil inventory numbers were released.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Crude oil took everything lower,\" said Ilya Feygin, managing director at brokerage firm WallachBeth. \"People were expecting oil inventory to be better than it was,\" adding that oil inventories have remained high despite a spike in gasoline demand during the summer driving season.</p> \\n\\n<p>Energy companies in the S&amp;amp;P 500 fell 1.1%, making the group one of the worst-performing sectors in the index.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advertisement</p> \\n\\n<p>Stocks that pay high dividends in the utilities and telecommunications sectors of the S&amp;amp;P 500 also fell as investors shed assets they bought to protect themselves in the aftermath of the U.K.\\'s vote to leave the EU.</p> \\n\\n<p>The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.387%, up for the second day after closing at a record low on Tuesday.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Those were areas that were very overbought,\" Mr. Feygin said.</p> \\n\\n<p>In general, Mr. Feygin said trading volumes for the day were lighter than usual as some traders and investors are waiting for the highly anticipated June jobs report set for Friday before making big moves.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"This is an environment that will be driven by macro factors,\" said David Jilek, chief investment strategist at Gateway Investment Advisers. \"Any bit of news or new data can cause a market reversal.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Last month\\'s jobs report showed the fewest jobs gains in nearly six years.

Claims were a seasonally adjusted 254,000, below the 267,000 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal were expecting.</p> \\n\\n<p>Some analysts said this stronger-than-anticipated reading could bode well for Friday\\'s jobs report.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even modest job gains would reassure investors \"that we\\'re not going toward recession,\" said Randy Warren, chief investment officer at Warren Financial Service.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, even if Friday\\'s jobs report is strong, it doesn\\'t necessarily mean there will be a rate raise anytime soon, some analysts said, adding that the Fed remains concerned about global conditions.</p> \\n\\n<p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve\\'s June meeting showed Wednesday that officials were divided on the path for interest rates.</p> \\n\\n<p>Investors remain convinced the central bank is unlikely to raise rates this year after recent weakness in monthly employment reports and market turbulence in the wake of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"Clearly they\\'re being rather cautious about the referendum, which is a little surprising given how insulated the U.S. economy is from a growth shock to the U.K.,\" said Edward Smith, asset allocation strategist at Rathbones.</p> \\n\\n<p>After the U.K.\\'s vote to leave the EU on June 23, global markets are reacting to the uncertainty of the impact of the political discontent on economic confidence, he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"You\\'ve got Brexit, and one eye on other European countries that could have referenda -- injecting uncertainty -- and you\\'ve got Donald Trump,\" he said. If \"Brexit was seen to be the maverick move, perhaps it leads people to give greater credence to the idea that someone like Trump could get into power,\" he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Democratic and Republican National Conventions begin later in July, and investors say the U.S. election is likely to become a bigger driver of stock markets during that period.</p> \\n\\n<p>In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 1.1%.

(Marla Brose/Journal)</p> \\n\\n<p>Sara Romero, a housekeeper, makes up the only bed - of 308 adult beds - available Wednesday afternoon at the University of New Mexico Hospital on Lomas Boulevard. (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)</p> \\n\\n<p>Copyright - 2015 Albuquerque Journal</p> \\n\\n<p>The new state-of-the-art hospital that the University of New Mexico is hoping will replace its aging flagship facility likely would rise several stories on the west side of University Boulevard, contain an estimated 350 adult beds and cost as much as half a billion dollars.</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>Once begun, construction probably would take about three years.</p> \\n\\n<p>That\\'s the prognosis for the construction of a new hospital - if the project gets the green light - given this week by Dr. Paul Roth, chancellor for Health Sciences at UNM, and other top hospital administrators during a meeting with Journal editors and reporters.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although UNM officials believe a new facility is desperately needed, approval by several agencies and boards is required. Construction is therefore no sure thing and forthcoming plans could face numerous hurdles, including potential objections from the community.</p> \\n\\n<p>At least four agencies need to give their approval before construction can begin: the Health Sciences Center board of directors, the UNM Board of Regents, the state Higher Education Department and the State Board of Finance.</p> \\n\\n<p>The new facility would be built near the UNM Cancer Center, located on Camino de Salud NE between Indian School Road and Lomas Boulevard.</p> \\n\\n<p>As the only Level I trauma center in the state, the hospital - which has 308 adult beds - also provides care in areas such as burns, stroke and neurology that isn\\'t available at community hospitals. Officials said, however, that they have turned away hundreds of transfers from other hospitals because of the crowded conditions</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>Best-case time frame</p> \\n\\n<p>UNMH is working with the global management consulting firm Kurt Salmon in developing plans for the new facility. A formal proposal is expected in a few weeks, and it is hoped that it can be reviewed and approved by the HSC, the regents and HED by July and by the State Board of Finance in October - a time frame that represents a best-case scenario.</p> \\n\\n<p>On Tuesday, Roth said the hospital\\'s capacity problem has only worsened in the two intervening years since an earlier expansion plan fell by the wayside.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nearly three years ago, UNMH began seeking permission to build a 96-bed, $146 million facility for expansion purposes. The HSC directors, the regents and the HED gave the necessary OKs, but the proposal stalled at the State Board of Finance.</p> \\n\\n<p>The lack of vacant beds and overcrowding is such a big problem that some patients are bedded down in the Emergency Department; others are placed in recovery rooms, sometimes for several days, waiting for an available bed in a regular ward.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"It\\'s an exacerbation of what was already a difficult situation for admissions,\" Roth said.</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>Previous opposition</p> \\n\\n<p>One party that opposed the previous expansion plan was the Lovelace Health System. On Wednesday, asked</p> \\n\\n<p>One of the entrances to the University of New Mexico Hospital: At the right is the 1950s-era, 308-bed adult wing that administrators hope to replace with a new state-of-the-art facility with about 350 beds.</p> \\n\\n<p>if Lovelace would support the new UNMH proposal, Ron Stern, president and CEO, responded via email: \"We cannot provide comment without knowing details of their plan. Lovelace Health System today, and in the near term, has significant capacity to care for emergency room, medical surgical and obstetric patients in our four hospitals and physician clinics.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>In opposing the earlier UNM expansion, Lovelace offered instead to make beds available at its downtown location. \"We can tell you this as far as Lovelace is concerned - given the current health care environment, a new big hospital in the downtown area is not what is needed at this point,\" Stern said at the time.</p> \\n\\n<p>Instead, UNMH should enter into a bed-sharing agreement in which Lovelace would take patients when UNMH\\'s emergency room was full, he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Kristen Krebs, director of public policy and communications at Presbyterian Healthcare Services, said in a statement issued Wednesday that the company\\'s practice \"is not to weigh in on specific projects at other institutions.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>Krebs said Presbyterian fully supports UNMH \"in its mission as a teaching and research institution that provides healthcare services for New Mexicans. We also appreciate any effort that seeks to consider the best ways to care for our community.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>As Presbyterian knows, building a hospital is a costly proposition. In late 2011, it opened the 68-bed, $190 million Rust Medical Center in Rio Rancho. A second patient tower is now under construction with a price tag of $89 million.</p> \\n\\n<p>Estimated cost, size</p> \\n\\n<p>Roth estimated that a new 350-bed facility for UNMH, all private rooms, would cost between $400 million and $500 million. About two-thirds of that would be financed through the sale of bonds, he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>\"We will not be seeking public funds either from the county or the state,\" said Billy Sparks, HSC\\'s communications and marketing chief. \"We will be using our own reserves and our own bonding capacity, once we\\'ve determined exactly what needs to be built and gain approval following discussions with our governing boards.\"</p> \\n\\n<p>Steve McKernan, CEO of UNM Hospitals, and Dr. Michael Richards, the executive physician-in-chief of the UNM Health System, said the new facility most likely would be a high-rise building, which is more practical than a one- or two-level facility that spreads over a wide area.</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>Transporting patients is easier and less time-consuming if elevators can replace long hallways, they said. Plus, it would use less land.</p> \\n\\n<p>The HSC\\'s projected budget for the coming fiscal year is nearly $2 billion, including $122 million for hospitals and doctors.</p> \\n\\n<p>The hospital operates the only Level I trauma center in the state, treating nearly 90,000 emergency patients and more than 450,000 outpatients each year. The Barbara &amp;amp; Bill Richardson Pavilion, which opened in the spring of 2007, added nearly 500,000 square feet of emergency and clinical space.</p> \\n\\n<p>UNMH also serves as the primary teaching hospital for the UNM School of Medicine and is home to the UNM Children\\'s Hospital and the UNM Cancer Center.</p> \\n\\n<p>The system includes Carrie Tingley Hospital, UNM Children\\'s Psychiatric Center and UNM Psychiatric Center. It shares missions and resources with the College of Nursing and College of Pharmacy and the New Mexico Poison Center.</p> \\n\\n<p>In addition to the main hospital, the system operates 43 off-site clinics statewide, including the UNM Cancer Center South in Las Cruces.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p />',\n '<p><a href=\"\" type=\"internal\" /></p> \\n\\n<p>We at Political Blind Spot were <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">amongst the first to report on the murder of Renisha McBride</a>, and unarmed African American woman who was shot dead in the back of the head, by a white man with a shotgun.</p> \\n\\n<p>In our initial report, we noted that &#8220;The police initially told McBride&#8217;s family that her body was &#8216;dumped&#8217; and discovered near Warren Avenue and Outer Drive.

If the media and police are going to try to sweep this story under the rug, let&#8217;s at least not make it easy for them!</p> \\n\\n<p>(Article by Isa Abu Jamal)</p>',\n '<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Supreme Court justices will soon hear arguments in a highly charged case over a federal ban on sports betting that, if thrown out, would open the doors for states to promote and profit from state-sponsored gambling on major league and college games.</p> \\n\\n<p>Even though sports gambling is legal in Nevada, the casino lobby is siding with plaintiffs in the case in hopes that an expansion of state-sponsored gambling would eliminate illegal offshore wagering and provide more regulation and protections to U.S. companies and consumers.</p> \\n\\n<p>Oral arguments in Christie v. NCAA are scheduled for Dec. 4. A ruling by the high court is not expected until next year.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the case, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie wants the Supreme Court to find the Professional and Amatuer Sports Protection Act, or PASPA, unconstitutional. The law, New Jersey argues, usurps a state&#8217;s right to regulate sports wagering and allows it in four &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; states.</p> \\n\\n<p>The NCAA and major sports leagues oppose lifting the ban. In briefs they argue PASPA adheres to the Constitution and the 10th Amendment and does not &#8220;commandeer&#8221; regulatory power by states.</p> \\n\\n<p>The NCAA is backed by major sports leagues &#8212; the National Football League, the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League. They say PASPA protects the integrity of games.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Trump administration has filed a brief siding with the sports leagues in the case, which initially was brought before the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals where judges ruled with the NCAA.</p> \\n\\n<p>Four states &#8216;grandfathered&#8217;</p> \\n\\n<p>Nevada, Oregon, Montana and Delaware are the four states where sports wagering was &#8220;grandfathered&#8221; when PASPA was adopted by Congress in 1992.</p> \\n\\n<p>New Jersey was given a one-year window to seek a sports wagering opt-in, but failed to do so. Since then, it has sought to bring sports wagering to casinos and horse tracks to boost their economy.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nevada and the casino lobby have backed New Jersey&#8217;s case before the high court and want PASPA eliminated.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Perception and attitudes have changed,&#8221; said Sara Slane with the American Gaming Association, which represents casinos in Nevada and other states.</p> \\n\\n<p>She called the law out of date, noting that PASPA was first adopted before the internet was established.</p> \\n\\n<p>Over the past few decades people regard sports wagering as an acceptable form of entertainment, Slane said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Christie said the perceptions have changed to such a degree that it makes the major leagues look like hypocrites now for opposing sports wagering on moral grounds.</p> \\n\\n<p>Christie told &#8220;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&#8221; that because major sports teams have moved, or are moving, to Las Vegas, a mecca for sports wagering, the major leagues &#8220;cannot make the &#8216;integrity of the game&#8217; argument anymore.&#8217;&#8217;</p> \\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">NHL Golden Knights</a> are in their first season in Las Vegas. The NFL <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">approved a move</a>that will bring the Oakland <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">Raiders</a> to Las Vegas in 2020.</p> \\n\\n<p>Impact on illegal gambling</p> \\n\\n<p>Advocates for repeal of the sports wagering ban also argue that doing so would provide tax revenue and regulation and reduce illegal gambling at offshore casinos not under U.S. oversight.</p> \\n\\n<p>The AGA says illegal sports gambling has grown to be a $150 billion yearly industry since PASPA passed 25 years ago.</p> \\n\\n<p>Giving states the authority to operate sports wagering would not only provide protection for consumers, it would create 150,000 new jobs and generate state tax revenues.</p> \\n\\n<p>Nevada casinos back the repeal, which would allow them to expand sports book operations into other states.</p> \\n\\n<p>Currently, there are 1,000 casinos operating in 40 states.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Supreme Court surprised many when it agreed in June to hear the case and review the 3rd Circuit Court&#8217;s ruling. Advocates of a PASPA repeal were hopeful the court would rule in their favor, but legal experts said it is hard to predict what the court would do.</p> \\n\\n<p>Will Moschella, a former principal associate deputy attorney at the Justice Department, said the Supreme Court didn&#8217;t decide to take the case &#8220;just to tell the 3rd Circuit that they got it exactly right.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>But Moschella said there could be varying ways the high court could rule.</p> \\n\\n<p>A majority could find PASPA unconstitutional and take it off the books, he said, or the court could affirm the lower-court ruling. Another possibility is that justices agree and reverse parts of the law, allowing the ban to remain in effect except in locales or sites.</p> \\n\\n<p>The timing of the ruling would depend on the multiple justices and opinions. Most agree the court would rule later next year.</p> \\n\\n<p>If the Supreme Court rules that PASPA is unconstitutional, most states would still need to pass local legislation to allow sports gaming to take place, Slane said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Contact Gary Martin at <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">gmartin@reviewjournal.com</a> or 202-662-7390.

This new spirituality is an adult search for meaning and direction outside of institutionalized Christianity as they see it,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Clifford believes one characteristic of the New Spirituality is to pick and choose from religious systems those elements it wishes to incorporate.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s eclectic, drawing bits and pieces of truth from different religions and spiritual sources,&#8221; he notes.</p> \\n\\n<p>New Spirituality focuses on making the individual the best person he or she can possibly become. In seeking this end, it draws heavily from Eastern as well as Western religious systems.</p> \\n\\n<p>According to Clifford, Pew research shows many Americans who indicate no religious commitment actually embrace New Spirituality. He observes a connection between pop culture&#8217;s fascination with the undead and the broader category of New Spirituality.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Our generation has known Christianity if only nominally, and is now exploring an alternative spirituality beyond Christianity and more embracing,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>Theologians like Clifford point out the piecemeal approach of New Spirituality leaves it without a central belief system. Critics of New Spirituality predict a philosophy that seeks to draw one thing from one religion and something else from another, and makes the self&#8212;even improving the self&#8212;its central focus and purpose cannot be ultimately satisfying.&amp;#160;</p> \\n\\n<p>Clifford calls the church&#8217;s response to new spirituality an &#8220;exciting challenge, because they are asking us spiritual questions.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The young people are searching through Twilight. They want to know how they can be the best person they can possibly be. So, we have a wonderful opportunity to connect with a thirsty generation,&#8221; he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It is wonderful to see what churches are doing and can do. I just think of this as an exciting time to be able in our way, not Bible-bash people, but to let them see that in the search for meaning today, we said no to the materialism, we said no to the chase for the dollar&#8212;the economic crisis has guaranteed that.

Zelikow continued. &#8220;Our main allies, like our government, don&#8217;t believe that talking is an end in itself. Otherwise we&#8217;ll talk and talk; they&#8217;ll build and build. Not a formula likely to relax tension.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Instead talks have to be part of a plausible strategy, a means to an end,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;The objective is to stop Iran&#8217;s nuclear enrichment. The chosen strategy, at this time, is still to bring maximum peaceful pressure on the Iranian regime to make that choice.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The challenge for Iran is to convince everyone that our goal is being realized (note the grammar here, as this is a continuous process that extends indefinitely into the future), and that means building confidence first through a suspension of enrichment while we work out arrangements that achieve our goal with extremely high confidence,&#8221; said one US official closely involved with Iran policy in an email. &#8220;If Iran wants to create a nuclear weapon, as many suspect, then they will resist the necessary measures to convince us that our goal is being realized and this will go nowhere fast.

For all the protests, though, there was nothing in the corruption that marked the Games that does not permeate every town and city, all the time. Just that, in these Games, it got concentrated in one very high-profile event, under constant public and media gaze. Much of the agonizing over what was routine corruption&amp;#160; was occasioned by &#8220;what the world will think of us.&#8221; For &#8216;world&#8217; read Western world. We care little about what Tuvalu or Tonga or Papua New Guinea think of us.</p> \\n\\n<p>The corruption &#8212; or its public manifestation &#8212; hurt us because it messed with our self-image and our need to be accepted as special by the Western elite, in every way, even at sports. After all, we are knocking at the door of the G-8. Else, there were no surprises in the corruption. Shocking, yes. Surprising, no. Dirty contracts handed out to sleazy builders? That&#8217;s business as usual in Mumbai, any day in the past three decades. Most of the city&#8217;s 36 MLAs are builders or contractors, which is its own comment.</p> \\n\\n<p>Shoddy construction? Footbridges that collapse? We figured out how flimsy were the buildings in Gujarat&#8217;s cities after the 2000 quake. Yet we continue to build huge high-rises in high seismic zones because there&#8217;s money in that. It was logical for the authorities to say of the collapsed footbridge in Delhi that it was meant for ordinary citizens, not athletes. (Read: It&#8217;s okay if ordinary citizens fall off it.)</p> \\n\\n<p>Kickbacks for the boys? Conflict of interest? You&#8217;re more likely to win the lottery than find the citizen surprised by these. Appropriation of the resources of the public, particularly of poor people? Well, Maharashtra shows you how. You can grab adivasi land &#8212; inalienable in law &#8212; for your private city and hill station. The Revenue Minister will &#8220;regularize&#8221; these violations for you. Contrast this with the daily struggle of people in Mumbai&#8217;s slums for &#8216;regularization.&#8217; Their massive contribution to the city&#8217;s economy counts for nothing.</p> \\n\\n<p>Shady banking and money transfer practices? The Enforcement Directorate has traced slush accounts involving IPL-linked entities to perhaps a dozen countries. Overpricing for car hire, for catering, for other services &#8212; all staples of Indian life. And speaking of contracts and food, it&#8217;s begun with the ICDS. Watch how midday meals, too, will steadily move from the hands of SHGs to those of private corporations in the name of &#8220;pre-mix&#8221; packages. Even as India falls to rank 67 (out of 84 nations) in IFPRI&#8217;s Global Hunger Index of 2010. A rank driven by high levels of underweight children. As the GHI report tells us: &#8220;India is home to 42 per cent of the world&#8217;s underweight children and 31 per cent of its stunted children.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Lying about objectives? Like saying the Games residential area would later become university hostels? When in fact several hostels were emptied during the Games (partly because of the water crisis the event entailed). And when the flats are being organized for sale, with prices already in the tens of millions.&amp;#160; Low-cost housing was the excuse used during the 1982 Asiad. And we know who lives in Khelgaon now. There are those who see the Games as a &#8216;Triumph&#8217; of the Private Sector and a Public Sector failure. Facts count for little in matters of faith. Who messed up the Metro Line? Public Sector. Who built the crumbling village? DDA. In truth: that sector of the Delhi Metro which did not get completed in time for the Games was the only line (probably the most profitable) that was privatized. And the giant private corporation failed to deliver. The Games village was not built by the DDA, but by a private entity. In any case, it&#8217;s simple: every single private scam and racket of our time is introduced through government, in the name of the poor.</p> \\n\\n<p>Displacement of people in and around The Games areas? Find a city, town, urban periphery or rural region where this is not an everyday fact of life. At any given moment, millions of footloose migrant laborers wander across the country, quite unsure about where the next meal comes from. Throwing out construction laborers when our work &#8212; their labor &#8212; was done in Delhi? Tens of thousands of migrant laborers, whether the Oriyas from Ganjam in Surat, or the migrants in Tirupur (owed back wages for months), or millions of others, experience this all the time. Contrast this attitude with this week&#8217;s good news &#8212; the anxiety and joy over the rescue of the Chilean miners, also in a society also beset by problems.</p> \\n\\n<p>A cheering elite, telling us how wonderful we are and how we have &#8220;showcased Indian talent for the &#8216;World&#8217;?&#8221; You can find that in most Indian newspapers or channels any day, any time. &#8220;India has showcased for the world,&#8221; declaimed one television anchor, &#8220;that we can and have and always will in the future organize and run world class events.&#8221; Let alone not looking beyond the world of the white and the western, what millions of Indians, including those thousands adversely affected by The Games, think, bothers us not a whit. Another TV channel ran a program on &#8220;What makes Indians world-beaters?&#8221; This, about India&#8217;s win over an Australian cricket team that has lost Adam Gilchrist, Shane Warne, Glen McGrath and Matthew Hayden. Interestingly, all the panellists gently dissented from the proposition that we could call ourselves world-beaters. That in no way fazed the anchor, though.</p> \\n\\n<p>Bad conditions? Athletes attending state and district level sporting meets have slept in disused railway wagons, and worse. These Games, anyway, were more about commerce and elite ego than about the athletes or their performance. The fine showing of some athletes came despite their organizers and sports bodies, not because of them. Now, they return to the bondage of bodies driven by profit, corruption and greed.</p> \\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s another matter we should never have organized this &#8216;mega-event.&#8217; In all cities holding such events over the past four decades &#8212; a tiny elite has made billions. The city has gone bankrupt &#8212; and ordinary people then pay the bills. Los Angeles is a good example. The &#8216;City&#8217; (i.e. Big Business) made huge profits. Residents paid the price for years afterwards. As did people in Montreal. As will those in London after the next Olympics there. Imagine, instead, if we had spent our billions on having playgrounds in all our schools? That way, you would really widen the sporting gene pool.</p> \\n\\n<p>The point simply, is this: The Commonwealth Games were no showcase, but a mirror of India 2010. If they showcased anything, they showcased Indian crony, casino capitalism at its most vigorous. To build such a society and then expect The Games won&#8217;t reflect its warts and sores is high optimism. But never in our history have an elite been so in love with themselves, so soaked in narcissism; so anxious about what &#8216;the World&#8217; thinks. So contemptuous of what our own people think, about anything. (Though the Commonwealth wouldn&#8217;t exist without them. Indians account for over 55 per cent of all people in the Commonwealth.)</p> \\n\\n<p>There is one anomaly, though, where the Games do not typify the Indian model. The Minister of Sports, shortcomings aside, is a person of integrity (as was his outspoken predecessor). He tried cleaning up various sporting bodies and was humiliated for it. He tried curbing the number of years a person could head a sporting body. Some, in their seventies, have been around decades (a couple in their eighties, too). That bombed, as well. On the other hand, the OC was about Organized Cronyism. Many of the tactics by which sporting bodies are run originate in Maharashtra. Sporting-politicians from there have headed more associations than they can count. Everything from kho kho and kabbadi, to wrestling and cricket. In some senses, the Games reflect the national expansion of the Maharashtra model. It&#8217;s the way this state runs its cooperatives, their banks, its education. The Games, like Maharashtra, were a snapshot of primitive accumulation at work.</p> \\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, may we suggest a modest alternative to Rahman&#8217;s theme song: Jeeyo, Utho, Badho, Jeeto (Live, Get up and ready, march forward, win)? It didn&#8217;t click too well, compelling the maestro to return to his &#8216;Jai Ho&#8217; from Slumdog Millionaire at the opening ceremony. There is some irony in that. That film outraged the same Indian elite and India Shining crowd. Leading Bollywood personalities spoke and blogged on how it had upset them. Yet the song found greater acceptance. It won an Oscar &#8212; showcasing us to the &#8216;world&#8217; &#8212; and that overrode disquiet about the film. Fact is: Jeeyo, Utho, Badho, Jeeto didn&#8217;t quite grab us. So how about: Jaao, Loot-oh, Utho, Bagho? (Go ahead, loot, get up and scoot).</p> \\n\\n<p>P.

For example, global M&amp;amp;A on a quarterly basis hit multi-year peaks in 2000 and in 2007, preceding sustained stock market declines.</p> \\n\\n<p>But market watchers told Reuters they see other reasons for the latest rise in mergers and acquisitions &#8211; including incentives from U.S. tax reform and the desire to take advantage of still relatively low interest rates &#8211; and instead view the M&amp;amp;A pop as positive for stocks.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a sign we&#8217;re late in the cycle and it eventually gets worrisome,&#8221; said Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab in Boston. &#8220;But in the near term it&#8217;s probably a plus in that you get deal premiums and more money employed in taking equity out.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>For an interactive graphic on global deal-making, click <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">here</a></p> \\n\\n<p>At a time when some on Wall Street worry stocks are trading at expensive valuation levels, investors said the willingness by companies to make purchases is encouraging.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;To the extent you can get cash deals done, it provides a lot of support for the market,&#8221; said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It takes out equities, where holders are likely to reinvest in other stocks, and helps re-establish that the prices that stocks are trading at are not too high.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Global quarterly deal-making hit a record $1.42 trillion in the second quarter of 2007. Several months later the S&amp;amp;P 500 began a decline that eventually cut the benchmark index by more than half as the U.S. economy sank into one of the worst recessions in decades.</p> \\n\\n<p>King Lip, chief investment strategist at Baker Avenue Asset Management in San Francisco, recalls that 2007 M&amp;amp;A spree as fueled by debt, and at the time, there were other signs the economic expansion cycle was ending, as opposed to now.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I just think we are not at that point in the cycle,&#8221; Lip said. &#8220;I still think we are mid-cycle in terms of this recovery.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Indeed, investors point to overall strength in the economy, including S&amp;amp;P 500 profits expected to rise about 20 percent this year.</p> \\n\\n<p>Another factor that separates the current climate is the recently enacted U.S. tax law, which cuts the corporate rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and includes a tax break for multi-national companies to bring back profits stored overseas.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I just view this increase in M&amp;amp;A more so related to the increased levels of cash that tax reform is producing,&#8221; said Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA Research in New York.</p> \\n\\n<p>While the spike in deal-making can indicate too much euphoria in the market, the lack of other indicators also pointing toward over-confidence suggests M&amp;amp;A could be an outlier in this respect, says Stephen Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco.</p> \\n\\n<p>M&amp;amp;A is &#8220;more positive than negative right now,&#8221; Massocca said. &#8220;If everything was over-euphoric, and people were more and more positive, then I would think it is a more dangerous indicator than it is today.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Diane Craft</p> Our Standards: \\n\\n<a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</a> \\n\\n<p>WASHINGTON/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his national security aides on Thursday discussed U.S. options on Syria, where he has threatened missile strikes in response to a suspected poison gas attack, as a Russian envoy voiced fears of wider conflict between Washington and Moscow.</p> \\n\\n<p>Worries about a confrontation between Russia, Syria&#8217;s big ally, and the West have been running high since Trump said on Wednesday that missiles &#8220;will be coming&#8221; in response to the attack in the Syrian town of Douma on April 7, and lambasted Moscow for standing by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump tempered those remarks on Thursday and even as he consulted allies such and Britain and France, who could join in any U.S.-led strikes on Syria, there were signs of efforts to prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Never said when an attack on Syria would take place.

This summer, the government has promised there will be no load shedding.</p> \\n\\n<p>A key plank of PML-N&#8217;s plan to fulfill their electoral promise rests on the three major power stations.</p> \\n\\n<p>But the delays to the three plants, all in Pakistan&#8217;s most populous state Punjab, have unnerved PML-N officials.

(Reuters) - Lucas Strom, who runs a century-old family farm in rural Illinois, canceled an order to buy a new $71,000 grain storage bin last month - after the seller raised the price 5 percent in a day.</p> Illinois grain farmer Lucas Strom checks on his tractor inside his barn in unincorporated Kane County, Illinois, U.S., April 10, 2018. REUTERS/P.J. Huffstutter \\n\\n<p>The reason: steel prices jumped right after U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs.</p> \\n\\n<p>Throughout U.S. farm country, where Trump has enjoyed strong support, tariffs on steel and aluminum imports are boosting costs for equipment and infrastructure and causing some farmers and agricultural firms to scrap purchases and expansion plans, according to Reuters&#8217; interviews with farmers, manufacturers, construction firms and food shippers.</p> \\n\\n<p>The impact of rising steel prices on agriculture illustrates the unintended and unpredictable consequences of aggressive protectionism in a global economy. And the blow comes as farmers fear a more direct hit from retaliatory tariffs threatened by China on crops such as sorghum and soybeans, the most valuable U.S. agricultural export.</p> \\n\\n<p>A&amp;amp;P Grain Systems in Maple Park, Illinois - the seller of the storage bin Strom wanted to buy with a neighboring farmer - raised its price two days after Trump announced aluminum and steel tariffs on March 1 to protect U.S. producers of the metals. Strom and his neighbor backed out.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Would that price destroy us? No,&#8221; Strom said. &#8220;But these days, you have to be smart about your expenses.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The metals tariffs also hitting makers and sellers of farm equipment, from smaller firms like A&amp;amp;P Grain to global giants such as Deere &amp;amp; Co ( <a href=\"/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=DE.N\" type=\"external\">DE.N</a>) and Caterpillar Inc ( <a href=\"/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=CAT.N\" type=\"external\">CAT.N</a>). Such firms are struggling with whether and how to pass along their higher raw materials costs to farmers who are already reeling from low commodity prices amid a global grains glut.</p> \\n\\n<p>The world&#8217;s two largest economies have threatened each other with tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of goods recent weeks.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump imposed&amp;#160;tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum in a move mainly aimed at curbing imports from China. He&amp;#160;has since temporarily excluded the&amp;#160;European Union and six other allies from the duties and given them until May 1 to negotiate permanent exemptions.</p> \\n\\n<p>A&amp;amp;P Grain President Dave Altepeter said the steel used in their bins is made in the United States, but domestic steel prices also have soared because of the tariffs.</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S. steel mills typically adjust their prices once a year, normally in the first quarter, Altepeter said. But this year, those prices have jumped four times, he said.</p> \\n\\n<p>The price of steel used in A&amp;amp;P&#8217;s grain bins has jumped about 20 percent since January 1.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Any time there&#8217;s any type of negative talk that affects the steel mill, they&#8217;ve raised the price,&#8221; said Altepeter.</p> \\n\\n<p>Last year, about 95,000 tons of steel was shipped to the agriculture industry, compared to the 14 million tons for the U.S. auto industry, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry group.</p> \\n\\n<p>Other factors had been driving up steel prices before the recent trade disputes, including&amp;#160;an improving global economy and accelerating manufacturing and construction, particularly in the U.S.</p> \\n\\n<p>The White House referred questions from Reuters to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which did not respond to a request for comment. Trump and Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue have vowed the U.S. government will protect farmers from China&#8217;s tariffs, but not explained how.</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S. farmers can ill-afford any loss of sales. Farm income has dropped by more than half since 2013, following years of massive harvests that have depressed prices for staples such as corn and soybeans.</p> \\n\\n<p>U.S. competitors Brazil, Argentina and Russia have all raised grain output in recent years, eating into the U.S. share of global markets. Mexico imported ten times more corn from Brazil last year and is set to buy even more in 2018 on worries that renegotiations of the NAFTA trade pact could disrupt their U.S. supplies.</p> \\n\\n<p>Strom said he has also pushed back plans to build a new metal storage building to house his planter and the combine head he uses for harvesting corn and soybeans. Other farmers, food producers and beer makers have scrambled to finalize deals for steel-based equipment before prices climb more.</p> Slideshow (2 Images) CONSTRUCTION POSTPONED \\n\\n<p>In Riverton, Illinois, farmer Allen Entwistle said he postponed construction of a new $800,000 storage system for grain after AGCO Corp&#8217;s ( <a href=\"/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=AGCO.N\" type=\"external\">AGCO.N</a>) GSI unit increased prices by 15 percent.</p> \\n\\n<p>Entwistle, who voted for Trump, will instead store corn in bags on the ground.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;President Trump keeps telling us he&#8217;s going to get a better deal,&#8221; Entwistle said. &#8220;When are we gonna make it better?&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>AGCO said Trump&#8217;s tariffs will raise its costs and make price hikes to customers unavoidable.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;As the entire grain storage industry has weathered increased steel prices, AGCO and GSI are constantly looking for new ways to maximize efficiency and minimize the impact to customers,&#8221; said spokeswoman Kelli Cook.</p> \\n\\n<p>Other companies, including Deere and Caterpillar, are also facing pain from rising steel prices, which account for about 10 percent of equipment manufacturers&#8217; direct costs.</p> \\n\\n<a href=\"/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=DE.N\" type=\"external\">Deere &amp;amp; Co</a> 150.26 DE.N New York Stock Exchange +5.85 (+4.05%) DE.N CAT.N AGCO.N \\n\\n<p>Deere CEO Samuel Allen told Reuters last month the company will have to absorb the price increase and cut costs elsewhere.

Dozens of armed plainclothes men on horses, camels and donkeys storm the square from Abdel-Moneim Riad, close to the Egyptian Museum. Scores of protesters are killed in the clashes which continue into the morning of 3 February. The square is saved by human walls of demonstrators formed at all six entrances. The&amp;#160;Muslim Brotherhood&amp;#160;and&amp;#160;Football Ultras&amp;#160;are at the frontlines and emerge as the heroes of what was instantly dubbed &#8220;the Battle of the Camel&#8221;.

Civil disobedience appears contagious with reports of workers from a host of public institutions beginning strikes.

The &#8220;We are all Khaled Said&#8221; Facebook page hails the army for refusing to fire at protesters during the uprising. In a meeting with youth activists SCAF generals vow to guarantee the process of democratisation and promise not to interfere in the political process.

SCAF appoints seven members &#8212; three judges from the supreme constitutional court and four legal experts &#8212; to the committee El-Beshri heads and charges them to draw up the necessary constitutional amendments within 10 days.&amp;#160;Mohamed El-Baradei&amp;#160;warns that the timetable is rushed, and tells Al-Jazeera that limiting the transitional period under military rule to six months is unrealistic.

The amendments set new conditions for eligible presidential candidates and limit presidential terms to two. They also mandate the next elected parliament to select a committee that will be charged with drafting a new constitution within six months. Presidential elections will be held after the assembly is formed. The amendments also limit the power of the president to declare or renew a state of emergency.</p> \\n\\n<p>28 February&amp;#160;: The prosecutor-general sequesters assets, including bank accounts, real estate holdings and stocks and shares, of Mubarak and his family. A travel ban is imposed.

His name had been floated by revolutionary youth coalitions to SCAF. Seven new ministers are appointed including Nabil El-Arabi, a former International Court of Justice judge, as foreign minister. Onetime Cairo Security Chief Major General Mansour Eissawi replaces Mahmoud Wagdi as minister of interior.</p> \\n\\n<p>4-5 March&amp;#160;: Crowds storm the notorious&amp;#160;State Security Intelligence (SSI)&amp;#160;headquarters in Alexandria where security personnel were destroying documents and takeover the building despite facing live ammunition. The move resonates across Egypt. In Cairo hundreds burst into the&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">SSI&#8217;s headquarters in Nasr City</a>, long known as Egypt&#8217;s Bastille. Thousands of SSI documents were already shredded but protesters managed to seize hundreds of intact files. One document that circulated on social media websites implicated Habib El-Adli in ordering the attack on the Two Saints Church in Alexandria on New Year&#8217;s Eve, but the document&#8217;s authenticity is questioned. The SSI raids are seen as a blow to Mubarak&#8217;s brutal police state.</p> \\n\\n<p>SECTARIANISM REARS ITS HEAD 5 March:&amp;#160;A romance between a Muslim woman and a Coptic man in Atfeeh village south of Cairo results in a gun battle between the two families in which the woman&#8217;s father and a Muslim fruit vendor are killed. A group of Muslims respond by burning the village&#8217;s church.&amp;#160;The military seeks the mediation of Sheikh Mohamed Hassan, a Salafi televangelist, to calm the situation&amp;#160;and vows to reconstruct the church by Easter. The issue snowballs as violent clashes erupt in Cairo following rumours of attacks on churches across Egypt.

The Muslim Brotherhood supports the amendments and Egypt is suddenly polarised between &#8220;No&#8221; and &#8220;Yes&#8221; camps. The &#8220;No&#8221; camp has reservations over the political process envisioned for the interim period. They want a constitution to be written ahead of elections which some argue could be postponed for up to two years, and accuse SCAF of marketing a &#8220;ragged&#8221; constitution instead of compiling a new one. Mohamed El-Baradei tells a TV talk show he will not run for the presidency under a flawed constitution. The &#8216;Yes&#8217; camp is given an Islamist flavour because of the Brotherhood&#8217;s support of the amendments.

Social media websites are saturated with &#8220;NO&#8221; user pictures as the political civil war unfolds. The results are a severe blow to liberals and presidential hopefuls Amr Moussa, Mohamed El-Baradei, Karama Party leader Hamdeen Sabahi, and judge Hisham El-Bastawisi, who campaigned against the amendments.</p> \\n\\n<p>Voter turnout is 41 per cent.</p> \\n\\n<p>24 March&amp;#160;: Military police violently break up an 18-day student strike at Cairo University where students and some staff are demanding the dismissal of the faculty dean.

The demonstration was called by the Muslim Brotherhood, the &#8220;25 January Youth Coalition&#8221; and several political parties who said they feared remnants of the regime remained in place in the media, the security apparatus and government bureaucracy.</p> \\n\\n<p>8 April&amp;#160;: For the second week in a row, hundreds of thousands assemble in Tahrir, this time for the &#8220;Friday of Purge and Trial&#8221;.

Approximately 190 Muslims and Copts are arrested the following day. Hundreds of Copts return to Maspero and start a sit-in to demand those responsible for the killing of Copts and burning of churches be brought to justice.</p> \\n\\n<p>Abeer hands herself over to the military police.

He is expelled from the Brotherhood.</p> \\n\\n<p>Foreign minister&amp;#160;Nabil El-Arabi&amp;#160;is appointed Arab League secretary-general after the resignation of Amr Moussa. El-Arabi&#8217;s removal from the Foreign Ministry is widely seen as a sign of SCAF&#8217;s annoyance with his statements regarding Gaza and Iran which had alarmed Gulf states, Israel and Washington.</p> \\n\\n<p>Thousands from across the political spectrum demonstrate in front of the Israeli embassy in Cairo to mark the&amp;#160;Nakba&amp;#160;&#8212; the catastrophe &#8212; ie Israel&#8217;s creation in 1948 on Palestinian land.

Prime minister Essam Sharaf and other cabinet members publicly oppose the amendments. Opposition mounts amongst secularists against a proposed&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">electoral law</a>, which&amp;#160;Mohamed El-Baradei&amp;#160;slams for not allowing Egyptians abroad to vote.

The news immediately triggers demonstrations in Tahrir, which turn violent when security forces confront protesters with heavy rounds of tear gas. It&#8217;s the first such confrontation with the police since the Interior Ministry&#8217;s withdrawal on 28 January. The clashes are echoed in Suez and Alexandria which witness a return to massive demonstrations and sit-ins that go on for days. It&#8217;s the first political crisis for the Essam Sharaf government. Over 1,000 are injured, including 70 policemen.</p> \\n\\n<p>8-9 July&amp;#160;: After much deliberation between political forces who want to avoid division Constitution First Friday is replaced by&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">the Friday of Reckoning</a>. Hundreds of thousands demand a purge of the security apparatus and justice for the revolution&#8217;s&amp;#160;shuhada&amp;#160;(martyrs) in demonstrations in Cairo, Suez and Alexandria. They also protest against civilians being tried by military courts. The first sit-in since Mubarak&#8217;s ouster on 11 February begins in Tahrir.</p> \\n\\n<p>After abolishing the Ministry of Information following Mubarak&#8217;s ouster, SCAF resurrects it and appoints&amp;#160;Osama Heikal, former editor of the Wafd Party mouthpiece and an ex military correspondent, as minister.</p> \\n\\n<p>12-15 July&amp;#160;: Two days ahead of the planned &#8221;&amp;#160;Friday of the Last Ultimatum&amp;#160;&#8221; SCAF spokesman Mohsen El-Fangari reads out communiqu&#233; 67 which warns that the army will not tolerate any attempt to &#8220;pounce on&#8221; power and legitimacy. The statement emphasises SCAF&#8217;s commitment to the timetable it has set out for parliamentary and presidential elections and the writing of a permanent constitution. His threatening tone provokes an angry&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">protest</a>&amp;#160;in Tahrir against SCAF, the Interior Ministry and the Essam Sharaf government. Sharaf responds by promising a cabinet reshuffle.&amp;#160;Yehia El-Gamal, repeatedly attacked by political forces, resigns from his post as Sharaf&#8217;s deputy.</p> \\n\\n<p>Demonstrations extend to Alexandria and Mansoura. Protests continue in Suez where seven police officers accused of killing protesters are released by a court.</p> \\n\\n<p>Tens of thousands pour into Tahrir on Friday 15 July to join protesters who have been camping in the square for a week. The massive demonstrations demand Sharaf&#8217;s resignation and the trial of Mubarak. The Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi groups refuse to participate. Other Islamist parties join.</p> \\n\\n<p>17 July&amp;#160;: The ministers of finance and industry resign. Economist&amp;#160;Hazem El-Biblawi&amp;#160;is appointed as minister of finance and deputy prime minister. He promises to set a decent minimum wage for public workers.</p> \\n\\n<p>29 July&amp;#160;: In response to the month long &#8220;constitution first&#8221; campaign by liberals the Muslim Brotherhood and Salafi groups hold a massive demonstration in Tahrir. The Brotherhood disapproves of but has no control over Salafis chanting that &#8220;the people want to implement the rule of&amp;#160;sharia&amp;#160;&#8220;. Attempts by activists to persuade the Salafi organisers to focus on national demands fail and the demonstration turns into an Islamist show of strength. The media calls it the &#8221;&amp;#160;Friday of Kandahar&amp;#160;&#8220;. Shocked, many liberals who were part of the Democratic Alliance respond to the demonstration by leaving the coalition and calling for the formation of a secular bloc.</p> \\n\\n<p>1 August&amp;#160;: On the first day of Ramadan military police and security forces disperse the three-week long sit-in in Tahrir Square.</p> \\n\\n<p>3 August&amp;#160;: Mubarak, his sons, El-Adli and six of his top aides appear in court in what is dubbed the&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">trial</a>&amp;#160;of the century. The trial is broadcast live on the third day of Ramadan. Millions watch in disbelief as the former president is wheeled into court on a stretcher and placed behind bars with the co-defendants. It is the first time Egyptians have seen Mubarak since his 10 February TV address to the nation. All the defendants deny the charges.</p> \\n\\n<p>8 August&amp;#160;: Eleven governors are replaced in a&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">reshuffle</a>&amp;#160;which fails to appease forces demanding meaningful political reform and the resignation of premier Essam Sharaf.</p> \\n\\n<p>15 August&amp;#160;: Ahmed Refaat, the judge presiding over Mubarak&#8217;s trial, imposes a ban on live television coverage.</p> \\n\\n<p>17 August&amp;#160;:&amp;#160;Ali El-Selmi, a former leader of the Wafd Party and Essam Sharaf&#8217;s deputy, floats a document of inviolable constitutional principles to which he expects the coming parliament, once it&#8217;s elected, to adhere. El-Selmi says that once there is agreement over the document it will be issued by SCAF in the form of a &#8220;constitutional declaration&#8221; that will include the &#8220;criteria&#8221; for selecting members of the committee charged with drafting Egypt&#8217;s new constitution. His statements spark outrage, particularly amongst the Muslim Brotherhood who refuse to support a document that will limit the actions of the yet to be elected parliament.</p> \\n\\n<p>PALESTINE 18-19 August&amp;#160;: Israel&#8217;s air force violates Egyptian territory in its hunt for Palestinian militants and launches air strikes that kill six Egyptian police guards. Thousands demonstrate in front of the Israeli embassy in Cairo. They demand Cairo recall its ambassador to Israel, expel the Israeli ambassador to Egypt and cancel the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. A young man scales the 23-storey building and removes the Israeli flag hoisted above the embassy. The scene shifts public attention to the Palestinian question which originally instigated the decade-long movement of dissent that finally toppled Mubarak.</p> \\n\\n<p>3 September&amp;#160;: The military builds a three metre high wall in front of the residential building that houses the Israeli embassy.</p> \\n\\n<p>9 September&amp;#160;: Thousands demonstrate in Tahrir to protest against SCAF&#8217;s management of the interim period. Most anger, though, is directed at the Interior Ministry the headquarters of which some young people attempt to storm. Hundreds of protesters head to the Israeli embassy and succeed in pulling down the wall and then storm the embassy itself. Tel Aviv has yet to issue an apology for killing the Egyptian border guards. Police clash with protesters, killing four and injuring over 1,000.</p> \\n\\n<p>10-11 September&amp;#160;: SCAF announces it will revive the emergency law in full despite Essam Sharaf&#8217;s month old promise to revoke it ahead of parliamentary elections in November. Security forces raid the offices of an&amp;#160;Al-Jazeera&amp;#160;affiliate station, Al Jazeera Egypt, which had broadcast live events at the Israeli embassy.</p> \\n\\n<p>24 September&amp;#160;: Tantawi testifies at Mubarak&#8217;s trial. Despite a media blackout his testimony is leaked. He says he was not aware of any orders given by Mubarak to open fire on protesters.</p> \\n\\n<p>27 September&amp;#160;: SCAF issues a constitutional declaration setting 28 November as the date for parliamentary elections to begin. The three stage poll is to be held over three stages, ending on 3 January. Details of the electoral law under which they will be held are made public.</p> \\n\\n<p>30 September&amp;#160;:&amp;#160;Six presidential hopefuls&amp;#160;release a statement announcing the expiry of the emergency under the March constitutional declaration. They give SCAF an ultimatum to go back to the barracks by March 2012. Mohamed El-Baradei doesn&#8217;t sign the statement which is ignored by the military council.</p> \\n\\n<p>4 October&amp;#160;: Angry&amp;#160;Copts&amp;#160;return to Maspero to protest against the partial burning of yet another unlicensed church, this time in Edfu. Military police use force to disperse the crowd.</p> \\n\\n<p>9 October&amp;#160;: A peaceful march organised by Copts and Muslims to Maspero comes under attack. The final death toll is 27, the majority killed beneath the tracks of armoured vehicles. Others were killed by live ammunition. A state-run TV news bulletin called on citizens to protect the army from &#8220;Coptic attacks&#8221;. The massacre sends shock waves across the nation. SCAF holds a press conference at which it denies running over the protesters or using live ammunition. It blames all the violence on an unidentified third party. SCAF&#8217;s response is unconvincing but divides Egyptians nonetheless. The council doesn&#8217;t apologise and Coptic rage grows when the military prosecutor is placed in charge of investigating the incident.</p> \\n\\n<p>12 October&amp;#160;: Registration for candidates in the parliamentary elections opens.</p> \\n\\n<p>25 October&amp;#160;: The administrative court grants&amp;#160;Egyptians abroad&amp;#160;the right to vote.

In response the Brotherhood organises a massive demonstration in Tahrir Square on Friday&amp;#160;18 November. It&#8217;s joined by several presidential candidates, the liberal Ghad Party, the Revolutionary Socialists and the 6 April Movement. The bulk of protesters leave the square in the evening. A small group of people injured during the uprising continue with a sit-in they began a week before.</p> \\n\\n<p>Attempts by security forces to violently disperse the sit-in on 19 November leads to the&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">return of the revolution</a>&amp;#160;to Tahrir Square. Thousands rush to support the sit-in as security forces attacked protesters with massive amounts of tear gas. The war zone is focussed on the entrance of Mohamed Mahmoud Street, off Tahrir. Approximately 42 people are killed and over 3,000 injured. Chants demand the &#8220;execution&#8221; of SCAF&#8217;s commander,&amp;#160;Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, and the immediate exit of the military. Tantawi makes his first TV address to the nation on 22 November in which he insists elections will be held as scheduled and brings forward presidential elections to June 2012. It&#8217;s the first time SCAF sets a firm date for the presidential poll. The El-Selmi document is retracted and the&amp;#160;Essam Sharaf&amp;#160;government resigns.&amp;#160;In a second TV address Tantawi states that the &#8220;position&#8221; of the Armed Forces in the new constitution will not differ from the 1971 constitution. Hours later SCAF issues a communiqu&#233; saying that an investigation into the violence would be undertaken by the prosecution-general. It also says that investigations into the 9 October Maspero clashes will be transferred from the military to the prosecutor-general. The military erect a concrete barrier across Mohamed Mahmoud Street.</p> \\n\\n<p>24 November&amp;#160;:&amp;#160;Kamal El-Ganzouri,&amp;#160;a former premier under Mubarak, replaces Essam Sharaf as new prime minister.</p> \\n\\n<p>ELECTIONS 28 November&amp;#160;: Egyptians surprise themselves when they queue for hours outside polling stations to cast their ballots in the&amp;#160;first stage of the elections, despite a climate of fear and uncertainty following the violence in Tahrir.

According to the Ministry of Health 17 died and 530 were injured. The state-run media describes the protesters as &#8220;thugs&#8221; and &#8220;vagrants&#8221;. The official narrative is undermined when it is revealed that senior Al-Azhar scholar Emad Effat, who was with the protesters, was shot and killed during the clashes.</p> \\n\\n<p>The building of the Egypt Science Institute is set ablaze. Footage of a veiled female protester being dragged across the ground by men in military uniform is circulated online. Her clothes have been torn away and she is being kicked in the head and chest by her booted assailants. The image is splashed across the front page of the privately owned&amp;#160;Al-Tahrir&amp;#160;newspaper under the headlinekazeboon&amp;#160;&#8212; liars &#8212; a reference to SCAF.</p> \\n\\n<p>The headline inspires activists to launch a nationwide campaign called&amp;#160;kazeboon&amp;#160;to correct media disseminated misinformation on the revolution and SCAF.</p> \\n\\n<p>28 December&amp;#160;: The trial of Mubarak, his sons and associates resumes.</p> \\n\\n<p>29 December&amp;#160;: Police and military personnel&amp;#160; <a href=\"\" type=\"internal\">raid</a>&amp;#160;17 Egyptian and foreign non-governmental organisations to investigate their funding.

The club\\'s proceeds from the IPO will be used to reduce its debt.</p> \\n\\n<p>The IPO may be a tough sell in the United States given the lack of U.S. publicly traded sports teams to compare Manchester United against and given that many Americans don\\'t regard soccer as a top sport. But the details of the sale were announced just as it was revealed that the club had signed a 7-year sponsorship deal with General Motors Co to have the Chevrolet brand on their shirts starting in 2014. The deal is worth roughly $600 million, Reuters reported.</p> \\n\\n<p>The club had filed to raise up to $100 million in its IPO of Class A stock earlier this month.

The road show stops will be done concurrently, with separate management teams covering different geographies. Pricing is expected on August 9. The team chose to list in the United States after scrapping listings in Singapore and Hong Kong. It had originally looked to raise as much as $1 billion in Singapore. \"I\\'m a little concerned that the offering couldn\\'t be done initially and now all of a sudden it has a heartbeat,\\'\\' said David Menlow, president of IPO Financial which tracks IPOs. \"The mentality with sports teams is that people like owning a piece as a trophy investment, but will it live up to expectations?\"</p> \\n\\n<p>The Glazers also own the U.S. football team the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

She&#8217;s planning to transfer to Roosevelt University in January but is running into familiar financial roadblocks.</p> \\n\\n<p>After her grants and scholarships are applied, and with her loans tapped out, Breyana still needs to come up with $1,167 for the semester. There&#8217;s the possibility of getting a work-study job on campus, but she knows that there is no guarantee.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t pull out, but I can&#8217;t exactly move forward,&#8221; says Breyana, a Chicago Public Schools graduate. &#8220;I&#8217;m down to the wire, moneywise&#8230;. There is always some kind of challenge going on. And don&#8217;t even get me started on how I&#8217;m going to pay for books.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The challenges that Breyana continues to face are common among low-income, first-generation college students of color. In Chicago, just half of CPS graduates who enroll in a four-year college end up getting a bachelor&#8217;s degree within six years, according to a <a href=\"http://consortium.uchicago.edu/sites/default/wp-content/uploads/publications/Fast%20Facts%20Brief.pdf\" type=\"external\">report last year</a>from the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research.</p> \\n\\n<p>Breyana&#8217;s story highlights another reality that contradicts traditional notions of college success: for many students, the path to a degree is no longer a linear one. Research from the <a href=\"http://nscresearchcenter.org/signaturereport9/\" type=\"external\">National Student Clearinghouse</a>shows that more than a third of college graduates will transfer at least once before obtaining a degree. The numbers for students who attend multiple colleges&amp;#160;but do not get degree are even higher.</p> \\n\\n<p>Breyana had originally chosen Monmouth College because she loved the serenity of the picturesque campus and the academic rigor. Monmouth is a private liberal arts college in a rural community about three-and-a-half hours southwest of Chicago.</p> \\n\\n<p>But she would soon face unexpected financial and social challenges. Even with loans, scholarships and aid, Breyana and her family struggled to make additional payments.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the middle of her sophomore year, a former adviser from her CPS alma mater, Chicago Academy High School, reached into his own pocket to help her stay afloat.</p> \\n\\n<p>Then, as police shootings and race became a major national issue, she began to question how well her own college supports black students on the mostly white campus.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;There were a lot of things on campus that were making me uncomfortable,&#8221; Breyana recalled in a recent interview. &#8220;I felt like I was stuck in a box where I didn&#8217;t belong.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>In May she decided to leave Monmouth.</p> \\n\\n<p>Campus officials acknowledge they aren&#8217;t doing enough to retain students of color and say they are trying a variety of tactics to address the problems. Among them: phasing out a discounted tuition rate for freshmen so that students are more familiar with the true costs later down the line; assigning mentors for each freshman; and sending more faculty to get training on how to become better advisers.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Even if just half of these things work, I think that&#8217;s huge,&#8221; says Dana Roof, the college&#8217;s director of academic support.</p> \\n\\n<p>Roof helped Breyana think through what type of college might be a better match. At the time, Breyana wanted to switch her major from photography and public relations to something in the hospitality and tourism industry. That major isn&#8217;t offered at Monmouth.</p> \\n\\n<p>She also encouraged Breyana to consider professional internships in the hospitality industry, which is how she got started researching a nine-month internship program at Walt Disney World in Orlando. Breyana says Roof helped her accept that it was OK to change course.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;A lot of first-generation students, they&#8217;re carrying a lot of weight,&#8221; says Roof. &#8220;They have the expectations of their families. They have their own expectations for themselves. In some cases, the expectations of their extended families and neighborhoods, depending on where they come from. That&#8217;s a lot of people to have to worry about besides yourself.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Breyana applied to Disney&#8217;s program and earned a spot for over the summer. She moved to Orlando within two weeks of leaving Monmouth.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I loved it so much,&#8221; says Breyana, who worked mostly in a merchandise store. &#8220;I was making people happy with the simplest things.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>She left the internship about half-way through it because of disagreements with roommates and because her mother had fallen sick in Chicago.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, her time in Orlando solidified her interest in the hospitality industry. She says she&#8217;d like to return one day and help plan events such as weddings.</p> \\n\\n<p>Back in Chicago, Breyana moved into her family&#8217;s home in the Austin neighborhood and took a part-time job at a mall while she studied her options for transferring.</p> \\n\\n<p>She looked at several colleges in Chicago before deciding on Roosevelt University in the Loop. It offered the major she wanted, had a diverse student body and was close to home. Much to her relief, Roosevelt accepted nearly all of her credits from Monmouth and her 3.6 grade point average.</p> \\n\\n<p>Although Roosevelt is a more diverse campus than Monmouth, its graduation rates aren&#8217;t as high. Federal data show that 41 percent of Roosevelt students &#8211; and 34 percent of black students &#8211; graduate within six years. At Monmouth, the overall graduation rate is 58 percent, and 44 percent for black students.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t look at rates,&#8221; Breyana says. &#8220;At that point I didn&#8217;t care. I just knew I had to find somewhere.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The two schools have similar price tags, although Breyana could save money at Roosevelt by living at home and commuting. But she plans to move into the university&#8217;s high-rise dormitories downtown in order to get the real college experience.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t decide to live at home to go to college,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I feel like that&#8217;s not going to college, it&#8217;s like high school. I feel like not only are you learning something different, you&#8217;re learning how to be on your own. Live with other people. Interact with other personalities. Otherwise, you stay in that comfort zone.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Throughout the entire process, Breyana has stayed in close touch with Andrew Johnson, who was an advisor starting her junior year at Chicago Academy High School.</p> \\n\\n<p>Johnson is a teacher who worked with Breyana and other students through OneGoal, a nonprofit organization that helps students prepare for college, navigate the application process and stay on track during their freshman year. The organization, which works inside 60 CPS high schools, is one of a number of nonprofits that focus on college access and completion in Chicago.</p> \\n\\n<p>Technically, Johnson&#8217;s OneGoal responsibilities with Breyana and her classmates ended in 2014, after most of them has completed their first year of college and re-enrolled as sophomores.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, Johnson continues to keep tabs &#8211; through Facebook, e-mails, phone calls and text messages &#8212; on many of the students he&#8217;s counseled over the years. He says he takes a &#8220;selfish gratification&#8221; in developing and maintaining long-term relationships with students.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I can be helpful to them in a way that very few other people can because of our long-term relationship and because it&#8217;s easy for them to reach out to me, without having to explain context,&#8221; says Johnson, who now teaches history at Westinghouse College Prep.</p> \\n\\n<p>But there are other reasons for staying in touch. &#8220;The issues that are going on for students during their freshmen year have not disappeared after the first year,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I think sophomore year is equally difficult because you can&#8217;t see the end goal. It seems callous to not be part of that relationship all the way through.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Explaining the model, OneGoal officials say the majority of attrition they&#8217;ve seen happens before students re-enroll as sophomores and that there is a significant drop in attrition after that point. Some of the major challenges that first-generation college students face as freshmen, such as meeting the academic rigor of the university or feeling like they don&#8217;t belong on campus, lessen as students figure out better ways to study, find help in office hours and develop social networks.</p> \\n\\n<p>Still, some of the barriers can persist throughout college. The feeling of not belonging on campus, for example, can continue if classmates drop out. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ve lost a significant number of students of color from freshman year who were your support or social network,&#8221; says Melissa Connelly, senior director of regional college persistence for OneGoal.</p> \\n\\n<p>In addition, finances can become a bigger issue after freshman year. &#8220;Some institutions do have decreasing aid after freshmen year,&#8221; Connelly says, adding that some students may have lost merit scholarships because of poor grades their first year.</p> \\n\\n<p>Breyana is determined to beat the odds. This week she got onto a payment plan with Roosevelt to spread the remaining tuition payments out across five months. She expects to lean on her parents for help, though she&#8217;s not sure how they will be able to come through.</p> \\n\\n<p>She wants to take classes over the summer to make up for lost time, and hopes that she can still graduate as planned in 2017. And she&#8217;s trying to stay optimistic.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I have to do that for myself,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I refuse to give into that sad spirit. For me, being a person that suffers with anxiety and depression, that&#8217;s one of my coping mechanisms. I have to find the silver lining, always.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>It helps to have a support team in her corner. More than anybody else, Breyana is grateful for Johnson, her former high school advisor. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t tell you how to fix it, but he&#8217;s a sounding board,&#8221; Breyana says.</p> \\n\\n<p>Johnson says it&#8217;s tough to watch former students stumble on their paths to college degrees.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I view her ride through college as bumpy and scary to watch,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But that&#8217;s what college is. She&#8217;s been changing, and some of it is what college is supposed to help you figure out.&#8221;</p>',\n '<p>Joplin, MO, after the tornado. Image from http://stevebeckow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Joplin-after-Tornado.jpg</p> \\n\\n<p>On May 22, 2011, an F5 tornado devastated the city of Joplin, Missouri; killing 159 people. The twister destroyed a large portion of the city, including the high school. Thanks to the efforts of city officials, school teachers, administrators, and parents, school began right on time yesterday.</p> \\n\\n<p>But that&#8217;s not the entire story. Earlier in the month, the United Arab Emirates embassy provided $500,000 to the school to purchase new Apple laptops for each and every high school student and has intentions to match an additional $500,000 in donations from others; which would make the total possible donation $1 million. The laptops will undoubtedly aid in learning and gives students something to look forward to as the school year begins.</p> \\n\\n<p>This is an extraordinary act of kindness from a people who have faced hatred in this country since 9/11. Even as Republicans in Congress hold ridiculous hearings to investigate the Arab community in America, an Arab country 8,000 miles away shows an act of kindness to a mostly Christian Midwestern community. It makes one wonder how anyone could hate an entire people because of one extremist act committed by a few, when it is clear that the majority of Arabs are great human beings.</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>Edited By: Alexis Atherton</p>',\n '<p>&#8220;Bless this day as it transpires and help me be the best Wavy Gravy I can muster.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The movie Saint Misbehavin&#8217; begins with Wavy ending his morning prayer as he always does; in his room at the Hog Farm Commune&#8217;s &#8220;Hippie Hyannisport&#8221; in Berkeley, surrounded by icons &#8211; sacred and silly. And, this excellent movie shows that he indeed has been a very good Wavy Gravy &#8211; one who has had plenty of loving help through the years as he&#8217;s been there spreading &#8220;Peace, Love and Granola&#8221; at so many seminal events of the Counterculture.</p> \\n\\n<p>The movie covers a lot of them, starting with the young Wavy (then known as Hugh Romney) hitting the Beat Poet circuit, hanging out with Lenny Bruce and sharing a Greenwich Village apartment with Bob Dylan. He morphed into a progressive stand-up comic who created the Phantom Cabaret with Tiny Tim and Moondog.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;And I also thought that Richard Nixon was the greatest political education we have ever had, but it looks like we need to relearn again.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Wavy was instrumental in the early Peace Movement (and still is) attending numerous rallies seeking to end the Vietnam War. Unfortunately, he has severe back problems (six operations, so far) from abuse at the hands of the cops at these rallies. He was such a Peace activist that, for awhile, he demanded to be hauled by friends to demonstrations while strapped to a backboard.</p> \\n\\n<p>While earnest about Peace and Justice, Wavy developed a more whimsical approach to politics in general. Wavy and friends ran a pig for president. They later settled on running the Nobody for President Campaign on the Birthday Party ticket. &#8220;Who&#8217;ll lower your taxes? Nobody!&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>After moving to California, Wavy fell in quite naturally with Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters, joining in on the epic Acid Tests and the famed Electric Kool-Aid cross-country trip. That led to the Hog Farm Commune &#8211; a life-long effort; we even get to see Wavy take his designated communal turn cooking for the gang. The Hog Farmers were hired to provide security (the &#8220;Please Force&#8221;) at Woodstock. Wavy served famously as an MC for the festival, as he has continued to do for many, many other such gatherings. Jahanarah Romney, Mrs. Wavy for 47 years, organized the food distribution for Woodstock&#8217;s famous &#8220;breakfast in bed for 400,000.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all done with people&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Soon thereafter, Wavy and Hog Farmers decided to drive supplies to Bangladesh (then East Pakistan) after one of the disasters that regularly befall the people of the low-elevation country. They drove across Europe and Asia in a bus caravan, stopping in Eastern Europe where they awoke surrounded by tanks and soldier. The friendly soldiers provided them with a ton of socks to distribute &#8211; an act of spontaneous generosity that Wavy admits changed his views &#8211; of both the Warsaw Bloc and military conscripts. They were welcomed and feasted in Iraq and in Afghan towns where people had photos of John Kennedy on the wall. (One can imagine it&#8217;ll be a long, long time before a US President graces those wall again.)</p> \\n\\n<p>They never made it to Bangladesh as the Civil War there prevented it. So, they took a turn and headed to Nepal where they started a life-long connection with the people there. The movie doesn&#8217;t show this, but Wavy likes to tell the tale of arriving at a monastery town and all the young, shaved-head, monks-in-training descended on the caravan. As he is famous for, Wavy broke out the kazoo and the bubbles and the kids went wild like kids everywhere; chasing down the elusive bubbles. A number of dour elder monks came out and chastised the entire of lot of them for engaging in such decadent frivolity. Then the wise abbot arrived, wondering about the hubbub and was delighted by the bubble scene. He saw it as the perfect teaching on Impermanence. New bubbles are regularly sent to the monastery where they are kept on an honored spot on the altar and once a year there is a bubbles holy day.</p> \\n\\n<p>From Nepal to a getaway in Michigan, the movie traces the origins of the <a href=\"http://www.seva.org/site/PageServer\" type=\"external\">SEVA Foundation,</a> founded by Wavy, his friends Larry Brilliant, Ram Das and others, to help cure preventable blindness in Nepal which they found was epidemic. For 30 years, Wavy and his many altruistic hearted musician friends have held benefits for SEVA. Many more have joined in as individual supporters. As of today, over 2 million successful cataract surgeries have been completed. SEVA has expanded its mission at Wavy&#8217;s behest and also now has reforestation projects going in many countries, including on Native lands in South Dakota. SEVA also runs Health Clinics in Native communities.</p> \\n\\n<p>Wavy is a great supporter of the Ancient Forest protection movement. He came up with the term &#8220;tree flesh&#8221; for paper. Wavy became involved in the efforts to save the Ancient Forests of the Northwest, hooking up with us at Breitenbush in the Oregon Cascades and elsewhere during the peak of the tree-sits, blockades, etc. He also came to Breitenbush with Ram Das for some memorable ten-day retreats in the 1980s. In the movie, Ram Das, Brilliant, Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Odetta and others speak of the putting his good where it does the most aspects of Wavy&#8217;s life.</p> \\n\\n<p>We also see Wavy&#8217;s great love, the Hog Farm&#8217;s Camp <a href=\"http://www.campwinnarainbow.org/\" type=\"external\">Winnarainbow</a> which is a northern California Circus Arts camp that Wavy and Jahanarah founded and have run for 25 years. With support from some of Wavy&#8217;s musician friends, Camp Winnarainbow makes sure that underprivileged kids get to attend alongside those who can afford to pay. There&#8217;s even an Adult Camp: as Wavy likes to note &#8220;it&#8217;s never too late to have a happy childhood.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>We don&#8217;t see any of the great Rainbow Gatherings that Wavy also was an MC for; and where I first met Wavy decades ago. And, I&#8217;m sure there are many other points on the Counterculture Data Line that involve Wavy that were missed &#8211; there are so many. But, take any Counterculture institution (strange word, but true) and you&#8217;ll likely find Wavy&#8217;s fingerprints somewhere.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all bozos on the bus. So we might as well sit back and enjoy the ride&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>So often the considerable efforts of Wavy and so many other compassionate, humanitarian hippies are dismissed, ridiculed and even demonized. It is so heartening to see a movie that celebrates all that is good about the Counterculture. <a href=\"http://www.rippleeffectfilms.com/wwwavy/index.php\" type=\"external\">Go see this movie</a>. You can&#8217;t help but feel uplifted spending time with Wavy; the guy Paul Krassner calls &#8220;the illegitimate son of Harpo Marx and Mother Teresa&#8221; and his amiable troop of co-conspirators.</p> \\n\\n<p>Wavy Gravy is Nobody&#8217;s clown!</p> \\n\\n<p>Wavy&#8217;s turning 75 this year and a Birthday Party/SEVA Benefit is scheduled for May 14th in Richmond CA and another one on May 27th in New York.

As vice president of the association&amp;#160; <a href=\"http://www.kapaqsumaqayllu.com/\" type=\"external\">Kapaq Sumaq Ayllu</a>&amp;#160;[sp], for 14 years she has been responsible for helping to protect a national cultural heritage in Peru, the 45-hectare Archaeological Complex of El Para&#237;so, one of the largest and oldest in Peru. It is in that spot that she spends her days. And it was nearby, on the Santa Josefina hill, that she built her house.</p> \\n\\n<p>The noise was coming from something that Estequilla could never expect, not even in her nightmares. A group of men were making use of heavy machinery to&amp;#160;destroy one of the eleven archaeological mounds registered on the site. Underneath this small mound, a pre-Inca pyramid, four to six meters tall and 2.5 square kilometers, which dates from ancient times.</p> \\n\\n<p>The place where one of the pyramids of El Paraiso was knocked down, as seen in the sand. Photo: Jessica Mota / Ag&#234;ncia P&#250;blica</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I was desperate, didn\\'t know what to do, because there is no telephone signal here. What I did was I climbed up the hill and told the watchman to call the police&#8221;, remembers Estequilla:</p> \\n\\n<p>Agora estou mais calma. Mas quando aconteceu realmente senti uma dor imensa, como se fosse uma pessoa, um ser muito querido para mim. Porque &#233; parte de meu pa&#237;s, estavam assassinando minha identidade, minha cultura. E isso &#233;, como se pode dizer, uma trai&#231;&#227;o &#224; p&#225;tria. Eu sinto que um peruano seja t&#227;o ignorante para destruir assim.</p> \\n\\n<p>Now I feel calmer. But when it happened, I really felt a deep pain, as though it had been a person, someone I had been very fond of. Because it is part of my country, they had been murdering my identity, my culture. And this is, as one might say, a treason to the nation. I am deeply sorry that a Peruvian might be so ignorant as to be able to destroy like that.</p> \\n\\n<p>Location of the Archeological Complex of El Para&#237;so in the region of the state of Lima, Peru. Design: Bruno Fonseca for Ag&#234;ncia P&#250;blica</p> \\n\\n<p>The Archaeological Complex of El Paraiso, one hour away from Lima in the county of San Martin de Porres, is located in an area where there is growing real estate speculation. Discovered in the 1950s, the site remained idle until December 2012, when the Ministry of Culture began to implement the project. As the years went by, the area surrounding the site was gradually taken up as private property. Today, the borderline of the archaeological site is right where the private plots and crops begin.</p> \\n\\n<p>There used to be 12 registered pyramids on the site. The main one had been almost completely restored by Swiss archaeologist Fred&#233;ric Engel&amp;#160;between 1965 and 1966. In January 2013, the sector responsible for excavations&amp;#160;in the Peruvian Ministry of Culture discovered evidence to suggest that El Paraiso is as ancient as the Egyptian pyramids or Mesopotamian civilization. Between 4,500 to 4,800 years old, that would be one of the cradles of our Latin American continent. It is proof that long before the Spaniards, the Church and even Christ, Lima had already become a major capital city.</p> \\n\\n<p>Marco Guill&#233;n, the chief archaeologist for the project developed by the &amp;#160;Ministry of Culture in El Para&#237;so, explains:</p> \\n\\n<p>&#201; uma das poucas cidades no mundo que tem uma continuidade cultural ao longo do tempo. E isso &#233; uma grande vantagem. (&#8230;) Lima, a capital, tem a waka [sic] (monumento antigo e sagrado) mais antiga do Peru. &#201; como a civiliza&#231;&#227;o surge aqui. A destrui&#231;&#227;o da pir&#226;mide significa arrancar a folha de um livro da hist&#243;ria do Peru. N&#227;o se pode saber o que aconteceu.</p> \\n\\n<p>It is one of the few cities worldwide which presents a cultural continuity over time. And this is a great advantage. (&#8230;) Lima, the capital city, has the oldest waka [sic] (ancient and sacred monument) in Peru. It is how civilization appeared here. The destruction of the pyramid amounts to tearing off the page of a book of the history of Peru. There is no way of finding out what happened.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the middle of the road, there was a pyramid</p> \\n\\n<p>As you leaves Lima, in order to get to El Para&#237;so, you must take a microbus &#8211; a kind of van which outnumbers other means of public transport in Lima &#8211; up to the neighboring town of Pro. It is a 40-minute journey through the hectic traffic of the Peruvian capital. From there, two more microbuses which will take you to the car, near the station, driven by one of the members of Association Kapaq Sumaq Ayllu. The landscape is bare, dotted with humble houses. As you arrive at the narrow lane that leads to the complex, you see open air garbage, vultures and children who seek toys amidst the dirt.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;When we arrived, there were billboards placed in every hill. They think that this area belongs to them&#8221;, says one of the project archaeologists. The sign reads &#8220;private property recognized on August 8, 1984&#8243;, followed by the description of the area and its registration number. Photo: Jessica Mota / Ag&#234;ncia P&#250;blica</p> \\n\\n<p>I observe a wall which hugs the side of the road the entire way. &#8220;It\\'s a wall&#8221;, explains Miguel Castillo, field head of the project of El Para&#237;so, who sits in the rear of the car. Later I would find out that the wall is 30 kilometers long and surrounds the hills in the region. As time went by, it was snatched up along the way by the private buildings and plots.</p> \\n\\n<p>Castillo ponders:</p> \\n\\n<p>O Estado &#233; ineficiente. Tem recursos para delimitar e proteger as wakas [sic], mas n&#227;o o fazem. &#201; igual no Brasil, na Argentina&#8230; O que se tem &#233; a iniciativa pessoal de algumas pessoas, de arque&#243;logos. Mas n&#227;o &#233; suficiente.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Government is inefficient. It has the means to set out and to protect the wakas [sic], but it does not do anything. It is the same in Brazil, in Argentina&#8230; What we have is the personal initiative from a few people, from archaeologists. But this is not enough.</p> \\n\\n<p>Members from the Kapag Association, together with their security people, had been victims of an attack a week before. For safety reasons, a watchman accompanied our group &#8211; with the entire team of archaeologists &#8211; while walking to the area where the pyramid had been destroyed.</p> \\n\\n<p>The native workers who previously used to be engaged in the excavation, now sit on the top of the hills, watching over.

By designating land as SEZ, the government hopes to speed the process by which developers can propose and build solar power plants. The SEZ&#8217;s are in Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, with about 214,000 acres thought to be suitable for near-term development.</p> \\n\\n<p>The government fast-tracked and approved eight utility-scale projects on public land this year in <a href=\"http://caivn.org/article/2010/11/09/six-utility-scale-solar-power-plants-now-approved-california\" type=\"external\">California</a> and Nevada. They will generate 3.5 GW when completed. &amp;#160;With this new initiative, many more such plants will be approved. The plan, which weighs in at a staggering 10,000 pages, is open for public comment for 90 days. In effect, the government is pre-approving land as suitable for solar so developers can have more confidence their applications will be accepted.</p> \\n\\n<p>Putting solar power on arid, sun-baked land that is generally inaccessible to most makes sense. By having the power plants in remote areas, they will be &#8220;out of sight, out of mind&#8221; and the NIMBYs presumably will be mollified. Another bonus, unlike wind power, solar is silent. Most of the proposed solar power plants are solar thermal, which uses the sun&#8217;s heat to power turbines, rather than photo-voltaic, which immediately converts the energy of the sun into power. A big advantage of solar thermal is that the heat can be stored, often in molten salt, to be used later to generate power when the sun isn&#8217;t out. But, solar thermal does require water, which would indeed seem to be problematic in deserts. &amp;#160;However, modern solar thermal design uses air cooling to convert the steam back to water, greatly reducing the amount of water used. Of course, such plants will use vastly less water than coal plants, which can also be sited on arid land in the West, and with no noxious emissions.</p> \\n\\n<p>The American West has huge amounts of unused public land that is ideal for solar power. This plan identifies areas where solar can be done with as little environmental impact as possible. In ten years, the West could be generating massive amounts of electricity from such installations.

I must have been asked that question dozens of times in recent weeks, as the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Pope&#8217;s election approaches. The answer I invariably give often surprises my journalistic friends.</p> \\n\\n<p>When I think back on the past quarter-century and ask myself what event or image or papal address best captures the meaning of John Paul II, I don&#8217;t find the answer in some of the more dramatic moments in the pontificate: his papal installation of October 22, 1978, with its clarion call, &#8220;Be not afraid! Open the doors to Christ!&#8221;; that epic first pilgrimage to Poland in June 1979, nine days in which the history of the twentieth century turned in a different and better direction; the showdowns with the Sandinistas in Nicaragua in 1983 and with Chilean rioters in 1987; the World Youth Days; the two great addresses to the United Nations; the opening of the Holy Door to begin the Great Jubilee of 2000. Rather, I think of something that took place out of the public eye.</p> \\n\\n<p>It was Sunday, March 26, 2000, the last day of John Paul&#8217;s jubilee pilgrimage to the Holy Land. A week of televised drama on the Mount of Beatitudes and in Bethlehem, Nazareth, and Jerusalem was drawing to a close. That morning, the Pope had prayed at the Western Wall of Herod&#8217;s Temple, Judaism&#8217;s holiest site, and then celebrated Mass at the tomb of Christ in the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher: two highly visible, very public expressions of his faith in the God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jesus. It seemed to both the trip planners and the press that the only thing left for John Paul to do was to complete the formal farewell ceremonies at Ben-Gurion Airport and return to Rome.</p> \\n\\n<p>The Pope had other ideas.</p> \\n\\n<p>Quietly, during lunch, he asked whether he might be permitted to return to the Basilica of the Holy Sepulcher privately, to pray as a pilgrim. The authorities were aghast; how could security be arranged so quickly? But things were eventually worked out, and John Paul, who had a different sort of security in mind, returned to the Basilica. Then it became clear why he had wanted to return.</p> \\n\\n<p>That morning, he hadn&#8217;t been able to pray at the eleventh and twelfth stations of the cross, which are on an upper floor of the great church. So now, a man just short of his eightieth birthday, who walked with difficulty and pain, climbed the steep, stone spiral steps up to Calvary. Having challenged the world to fearlessness &#8211; and having embodied fearlessness himself for more than two decades &#8211; he now wanted to pray at the place where the Son of God, taking all the world&#8217;s fear upon himself, had offered that fear, and himself, to the Father. That self-emptying, and the divine answer given to it in the resurrection, had enabled all of us to live without fear. That was why John Paul II was determined to pray at Calvary. He wanted to pray at the place where fear had been conquered through radical obedience and self-emptying love.</p> \\n\\n<p>The entire pontificate comes into focus here, I think. John Paul II has been many things for the Church and the world these past twenty-five years: a brilliant teacher, a compelling leader, a shining personal example. He is all of those things, however, because he is first and foremost a Christian disciple. The exceptional talents and personal magnetism of Karol Wojtyla do not explain his accomplishments, nor do they get us to the core of his person. We have to look deeper for explanations and understanding.</p> \\n\\n<p>We have to look to his faith. You cannot understand Karol Wojtyla, whom the world knows as Pope John Paul II, without confronting one, adamant fact: he truly believes, with every fiber of his being, that Jesus Christ is the answer to the question that is every human life. That is the conviction that makes him who and what he is. That is the conviction that drives his teaching, that makes possible his accomplishments, and that focuses his talents and his personality.</p> \\n\\n<p>He is the great Christian witness of our time.</p> \\n\\n<p>George Weigel is Distinguished Senior Fellow of the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. and holds EPPC&#8217;s William E.

Wynne Coleman defeated two challengers to win his seat in the Feb. 7 election, and will be sworn in later this month.</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll miss being a significant part of a successful organization,&#8221; Schlichte told the Journal, standing behind the board table where he spent so many hours. &#8220;Rio Rancho has always been a winning district.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>While Schlichte looks back on his service fondly, he is ready to move on, literally and figuratively.</p> \\n\\n<p>The 60-year-old retired evangelical pastor plans to concentrate on his business, G5T, which teaches financial education, and possibly relocate to another state with his wife, Trish. They haven&#8217;t decided where to head next, but California, Colorado, Texas and Arizona are in the running.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;That is on the horizon,&#8221; said Schlichte, who has flipped real estate for years. &#8220;It is exciting.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Administrators and board members say his calm, analytical style will be missed.</p> \\n\\n<p>Board vice president Catherine Cullen noted that Schlichte was always honest and fair, offering sound advice and making tough decisions for the good of the district.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;He served during the recession and also when the district saw tremendous growth,&#8221; Cullen said. &#8220;He dedicated countless hours to our community and school district.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Superintendent V. Sue Cleveland, who has led RRPS since its inception in 1994, echoed those sentiments.</p> \\n\\n<p>ADVERTISEMENT</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Over 16 years, through good times and during challenging circumstances, Don earned the respect and confidence of parents, staff, and community leaders,&#8221; Cleveland said during Schlichte&#8217;s farewell dinner on Monday. &#8220;It has been said conviction, commitment, credibility are the foundations for morally courageous leadership and those words have always defined Don&#8217;s contributions as a leader in the Rio Rancho Public School District and community.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>That spirit of community service motivated Schlichte to run for school board in 2001.</p> \\n\\n<p>A Minnesota native, Schlichte had first moved to Texas for a job as a pastor, then came to New Mexico in 1986, where he led Rio West Community Church.</p> \\n\\n<p>The father of six was heavily involved with the school system and looking for a way to give back.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I have always had a philosophy that you should be engaged in the community at whatever level and format fits you,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what got me into it.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Don Schlichte, who represented District 1 on the RRPS Board of Education, did not seek reelection after 16 years of service. (Adolphe Pierre-Louis/Albuquerque Journal)</p> \\n\\n<p>Over the years, Schlichte found a kind of second family at the district.</p> \\n\\n<p>He believes those tight bonds are a major factor in RRPS&#8217; consistently solid performance, including standardized test scores and graduation rates that far outpace the state average.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The previous boards had developed a culture of excellence and putting kids first,&#8221; Schlichte said. &#8220;We also have really outstanding professionals. &#8230; We have trust in the administration, and the administration basically has trust in the board overall, so it makes for a good professional relationship.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Schlichte also complemented Cleveland&#8217;s &#8220;character and competency,&#8221; which sets the tone for the rest of the staff.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;I learned right away that if you don&#8217;t have an excellent superintendent, your school district is in trouble,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Board members cannot make up for your senior executive&#8217;s failures. I realized right away that we have a huge advantage here, and Dr. Cleveland&#8217;s tenure has proven that.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Schlichte said he felt his role was to work as a liaison between the community and administration, while giving the district&#8217;s &#8220;pros&#8221; the freedom to create valuable programs and hire good staff.</p> \\n\\n<p>In recent months, he has stood up to fight legislative budget cuts that threaten to &#8220;gut&#8221; RRPS. Already, the district has lost $3.8 million for the current fiscal year, with more reductions under consideration for 2018.</p> \\n\\n<p>As he leaves public service, Schlichte hopes to see RRPS maintain enough funding to continue delivering the kind of quality education that has drawn accolades from the governor and lawmakers.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;We felt a need to sound the alarm,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know that Rio Rancho Schools is an economic driver in our community and our state. That is why we have been as vocal as we have because you are gutting one of your star organizations. We don&#8217;t want that to happen for Rio Rancho or New Mexico.</p> \\n\\n<p />',\n '<p>President Obama has nominated five candidates to serve, including two Republicans.

It was so senseless and so tragic to see two teens lose their lives at the very time when their futures looked the brightest. We pray for them and their families.</p> \\n\\n<p>The tragedy caused our world to tilt a little. Although we probably knew better, many of us had the feeling that maybe New Mexico was a little safer than many other places, that the horrors others faced might not touch us here. Last week, those blinders were ripped off, and we can no longer deny that New Mexico is a part of the bigger world and that we are not exempt from the problems everyone is facing.</p> \\n\\n<p>We can no longer limit our concerns to poverty, crime, education; we now have to add the random acts of violence that destroy innocent lives.

It probably means a lot of listening, learning, understanding and combining common sense, tough love and compassion, tolerance and acceptance of diverse beliefs. We may be able to resolve these problems, but it won&#8217;t be easy, and it won&#8217;t happen quickly.</p> \\n\\n<p>In the meantime, we have to cope.

This Thursday we have an opportunity to celebrate the Winter Solstice, to know that it is the longest night of the year &#8211; and, beginning the next day, the days will be longer, we will have more sunshine and our days will be brighter. It&#8217;s a day filled with hope, filled with the promise of brighter times to come.</p> \\n\\n<p>Maybe we need that promise of hope, especially this year.

It may sound outrageous, since after all, it&#8217;s illegal to sell off unneeded expense account receipts to someone who could use the tax deduction. But it&#8217;s perfectly legal. In fact, for states who wish to encourage industry, it&#8217;s a condoned and common practice.</p> \\n\\n<p>Continue Reading Below</p> \\n\\n<p>There are three kinds of state tax credits: 1) transferable&amp;#160; 2) refundable and 3) nontransferable and nonrefundable. The federal government does not allow the transfer of federal tax credits.</p> \\n\\n<p>Almost every state that levies an income tax creates incentives for small business in the form of tax credits. &amp;#160;According to Danny Bigel, CEO and co-founder of TheOIX.com, who facilitates the market for these credits, states issue about $10 billion in state tax credits annually with half of those being &amp;#160;transferable. In California we have, among others, such credits as the Research and Development credit, the Empowerment Zone credit and the Enterprise Zone credit. These credits attract businesses that have large research and development departments and also bring industry and housing into areas suffering from urban decay.</p> \\n\\n<p>Oftentimes, the holder of the credit doesn&#8217;t rack up enough of a state tax liability in order to use it, but they may have the option to carry forward the credit to subsequent years when it will prove beneficial. But for holders who need working capital right away, some states have made many of these credits transferable, and can put the credit on the open market.</p> \\n\\n<p>You may wonder why states have made this type of transaction legal. Think of the boon this is to a business&#8217; supply of working capital. First of all, a business is usually in a bad financial position if it cannot use a tax credit.&amp;#160;This usually means the business had such a bad year that it had no liability whatsoever.&amp;#160; If a business can sell an unused tax credit, it will improve its cash flow.</p> \\n\\n<p>Traded credits go for as low as $20,000 all the way up to $20 million, according to Bigel. &amp;#160;&#8220;The OIX&amp;#160; is bringing a traditional bid/ask market dynamic to the transferable tax-credit space on a state-by-state basis. With the OIX, businesses and individuals (typically high net worth) can get in the game to offset their state tax liability,&#8221; said Bigel.</p> \\n\\n<p>Advertisement</p> \\n\\n<p>He added that selling credits is a win for all parties. &#8220;[Businesses] reduce their liabilities and pick up immediate yield; they&#8217;re providing liquidity and they now have more income to invest in their community. Sellers and buyers and therefore the states win.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The ability to transfer tax credits is a relatively new phenomenon, but has been taking place in California for a little more than a decade. It&#8217;s brought up questions, such as what would happen if a taxpayer&#8217;s <a type=\"external\" href=\"\" /> transfers a credit and the credit is partially or completely disallowed in a subsequent audit. The kinks will get worked out as time passes. And maybe this is just what the IRS is waiting for &#8211; a smoothed out protocol before they decide to instigate the same transactions at the federal level. Perhaps this is considered a key to resolving some of our economic issues.</p>',\n '<p /> \\n\\n<p>Hillary has a Public position and a Private private position according to Wikileaks.

Trump a going away present after their meeting on Wednesday. It was a copy of his encyclical on the challenge of climate change, <a href=\"http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html\" type=\"external\">&#8220;Laudato Si.&#8221;</a></p> \\n\\n<p>This document begins with a paean to Saint Francis, which celebrates the natural world as a revelation of God rather than as a set of resources to loot and exploit and deplete.</p> \\n\\n<p>Pope Francis wrote,</p> \\n\\n<p /> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;The urgent challenge to protect our common home includes a concern to bring the whole human family together to seek a sustainable and integral development, for we know that things can change.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>The key words here are &#8216;family,&#8217; &#8216;sustainable&#8217; and &#8216;development.&#8221; Francis is making it clear that humanity is all one family and that he is not advocating any sort of Luddism or ecological escapism. He wants development&#8211; scientific advance and economic improvement. But he wants it to be accomplished in a sustainable manner.</p> \\n\\n<p>Sustainability means that resources aren&#8217;t permanently depleted&#8211; resources like water and fuel.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Regrettably, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis have proved ineffective, not only because of powerful opposition but also because of a more general lack of interest. Obstructionist attitudes, even on the part of believers, can range from denial of the problem to indifference, nonchalant resignation or blind confidence in technical solutions. We require a new and universal solidarity.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Francis considers the challenge of acting to prevent debilitating climate change. He warns that we cannot sit back and just hope for a technological fix. New technologies are key, of course. But he points to powerful opposition and also to public apathy. The opposition can interfere with technology, as with those states, like Florida, that levy punitive taxes or fees on solar panels in an attempt to keep people hooked on fossil fuels.</p> \\n\\n<p>The answer to both obstructionism (stemming from greed) and apathy is solidarity, is standing together across the social categories.</p> \\n\\n<p>When he gave Trump this work, Pope Francis was aware that Trump is a major climate obstructionist. He is nevertheless appealing for human solidarity in the face of a dire threat. Believers don&#8217;t give up on people.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;Some forms of pollution are part of people&#8217;s daily experience. Exposure to atmospheric pollutants produces a broad spectrum of health hazards, especially for the poor, and causes millions of premature deaths. People take sick, for example, from breathing high levels of smoke from fuels used in cooking or heating. There is also pollution that affects everyone, caused by transport, industrial fumes, substances which contribute to the acidification of soil and water, fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, herbicides and agrotoxins in general. Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Millions of people, the Pope says, are killed every year by air pollution. The seas are in danger of a mass die-off of marine life because of acidification. An ecology is a dense network of inter-relationships, he underlines. Trying to address one problem (e.g. transportation emissions) may only create others if a broad, holistic approach is not taken. Electric cars, e.g., are only able to substantially reduce emissions if the power plants that provide their electricity are not run on coal.</p> \\n\\n<p>&#8220;A very solid scientific consensus indicates that we are presently witnessing a disturbing warming of the climatic system. In recent decades this warming has been accompanied by a constant rise in the sea level and, it would appear, by an increase of extreme weather events, even if a scientifically determinable cause cannot be assigned to each particular phenomenon. Humanity is called to recognize the need for changes of lifestyle, production and consumption, in order to combat this warming or at least the human causes which produce or aggravate it.&#8221;</p> \\n\\n<p>Pope Francis notes the near unanimity of scientists on the danger of human-made climate change. Extreme weather and sea level rise are among the dangers. We have to stop emitting so much carbon dioxide, and that will require changes in our styles of life.</p> \\n\\n<p>But above all it will require a conscience and dedication and solidarity.</p> \\n\\n<p>Trump is a little unlikely to get it. But the point of publicly bestowing on him this gift is that the Pope hopes the rest of us will.</p>',\n '<p>Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle have inked book deals with Penguin Random House in which they are likely to be paid tens of millions of dollars, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/be94a52301814f4d8e612e034e6db6ac/Barack-and-Michelle-Obama-have-book-deals?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=APEntertainment\" type=\"external\">according to AP</a>.
